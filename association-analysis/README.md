# Association Analysis

> People don't which flags to use in different scenarios.

This is a more scaled version of the original montecarlo simulation. For this small
analysis we have updated [montecarlo.py](montecarlo.py) so that it can run in parallel,
each time with a different script to run some number of iterations over. We have
also moved this processing to happen in temporary directories to keep the repository
a bit neater.

0. Make so montecarlo can run in parallel
1. Run MonteCarlo on all analyses here: https://github.com/sinairv/Cpp-Tutorial-Samples
2. Extract "features" of each with GoSmeagle (or similar to get code structure), turn into matrices
3. Make assocations between features and compile flags or compile time

## Usage

```bash
$ python -m venv env
$ source env/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Generate Flags

The flags should already have been generated one folder up in [data](../data). Note that we are using
the set without warnings (high 700s).

### Run Analysis!

Provide a path to the flags, and the root directory defaults to pwd, and give the filename to look for to compile:

```bash
$ python montecarlo.py run ../data/gpp_flags.json Prog.cpp
```

In practice, I found that using parallel made more sense (no workers in Python).
Here is how to test a single script:

```bash
$ python montecarlo-parallel.py run ../data/gpp_flags.json "./examples/sizeof Operator/Prog.cpp" --outdir-num 1 --num-iter 2000
```

And then to run using parallel (`apt-get install -y parallel`)

```bash
$ find ./examples -name "*Prog.cpp" | parallel -I% --max-args 1 python montecarlo-parallel.py run ../data/gpp_flags.json "%" --outdir-num 1 --num-iter 2000
```

There is a [run.sh](run.sh) script that I used, and ultimately ran between a range of 0 and 29 (to generate 30 runs of the same predictions for 100 iterations each).

### Find common flags

After we've run this many times, we'd want to see some kind of signal of common flags across runs. We can calculate the percentage
of time that we see each flag for each result file.

```bash
$ python flag_popularity.py assess data/results/montecarlo-association-analysis
```

### Tokenize

Next, we would want to say "It's common for code with arrays to have better performance when compiled with these flags." To
avoid the complexities of parsing assembly (or something like that) instead we are going to tokenize
the CPP code, and keep track of counts for the number of things that we find (e.g., strings, for loops, etc.).
To do that:

```bash
$ python create_token_features.py examples Prog.cpp
```
